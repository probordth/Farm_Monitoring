# Iot_Based Farm Monitoring

In brief, this project was designed to enhance or improve the awareness of a farmer towards his/her agricultural environment. In the present, many manual monitoring methods do exist within the farming community (e.g. Soil Test Kit). However, they require additional human labour and aren't producing results at real time. Therefore, this proposed monitoring system is a better and efficient method which can be introduced to the farming community and we hope that this will enhance the productivity and awareness within the farming community.
